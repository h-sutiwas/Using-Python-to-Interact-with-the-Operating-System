    "r\"\\[(\\d+)\\]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This regular expression matches a string enclosed in square brackets followed by one or more digits. Then, it uses the `re.search()` function to search the string log for a match to the regular expression. The `re.search()` function returns a Match object if a match is found, or None if no match is found. the `re.search()` function returns a Match object because the string log contains a match to the regular expression. The Match object has a `group()` method that returns the captured groups from the match. In this case, the only captured group is the number, which is returned by the `result[1]` expression."

    "## **Regular expressions**\n",
    "A regular expression—sometimes called regex—is a string of characters that specifies a pattern to match against some text. In addition to matching patterns, they can search to extract specific parts of text, validate input data, and are supported by code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs). In this reading, you will look at some examples of common regexes used in coding. \n",

    "### **Regex examples**\n",
    "`r”\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}”`  This line of code matches U.S. phone numbers in the format 111-222-3333.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`r”^-?\\d*(\\.\\d+)?$”`  This line of code matches any positive or negative number, with or without decimal places.\n",

    "### **Helpful tool**\n",
    "Sometimes regexes can be complex and difficult to read and understand—even for experienced programmers!

    "## **Advanced regular expressions**\n",
    "Advanced regular expressions—commonly referred to as advanced regexes—are used by developers to execute complicated pattern matching against strings. In this reading, you will learn about some of the common examples of advanced regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Alterations**\n",
    "An alteration matches any one of the alternatives separated by the pipe | symbol. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`r\"location.*(London|Berlin|Madrid)\"`** \n",
    "\n",
    "This line of code will match the text string **`location is London`**, **`location is Berlin`**, or **`location is Madrid`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Matching only at the beginning or end**\n",
    "If you use the circumflex symbol (also known as a caret symbol) ^ as the first character of your regex, it will match only if the pattern occurs at the start of the string. Alternatively, if you use the dollar sign symbol $ at the end of a regex, it will match only if the pattern occurs at the end. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`r”^My name is (\\w+)” `**\n",
    "\n",
    "This line of code will match **`My name is Asha`** but not **`Hello. My name is Asha.`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Character ranges**\n",
    "Character ranges can be used to match a single character against a set of possibilities. Let’s look at a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`r”[A-Z]`** This will match a single uppercase letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`r”[0-9$-,.]`** This will match any of the digits zero through nine, or the dollar sign, hyphen, comma, or period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two examples above are often combined with the repetition qualifiers. Let’s look at one more example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`r”([0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4})”`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This line of code will match a U.S. phone number such as **`888-123-7612`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Backreferences**\n",
    "A backreference is used when using re.sub() to substitute the value of a capture group into the output. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`re.sub(r”([A-Z])\\.\\s+(\\w+)”, r”Ms. \\2”, “A. Weber and B. Bellmas have joined the team.”)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This line of code will produce **`Ms. Weber and Ms. Bellmas have joined the team.`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lookahead**\n",
    "A lookahead matches a pattern only if it’s followed by another pattern. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the regex was `r”(Test\\d)-(?=Passed)”` and the string was `“Test1-Passed, Test2-Passed, Test3-Failed, Test4-Passed, Test5-Failed”` the output would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Test1, Test2, Test4`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways\n",
    "The types of advanced regular expressions explained in this reading are just some of the more commonly used ones by developers. They are beneficial in pattern matching, text manipulation, and data validation. For more information, check out the following link:\n",

    "1. Working with a CSV file that contains employee information. Each record has a name field, followed by a phone number field, and a role field. The phone number field contains U.S. phone numbers and needs to be modified to the international format, with \"+1-\" in front of the phone number. The rest of the phone number should not change. Fill in the regular expression, using groups, to use the transform_record function to do that.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. The transform_comments function converts comments in a Python script into those usable by a C compiler. This means looking for text that begins with a hash mark (#) and replacing it with double slashes (//), which is the C single-line comment indicator. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll ignore the possibility of a hash mark embedded inside of a Python command, and assume that it's only used to indicate a comment. We also want to treat repetitive hash marks (##), (###), etc., as a single comment indicator, to be replaced with just (//) and not (#//) or (//#). Fill in the parameters of the substitution method to complete this function: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "def transform_comments(line_of_code):\n",
    "  result = re.sub(r'(#+)','//', line_of_code)\n",
    "  return result\n",
    "\n",
    "print(transform_comments(\"### Start of program\")) \n",
    "# Should be \"// Start of program\"\n",
    "print(transform_comments(\"  number = 0   ## Initialize the variable\")) \n",
    "# Should be \"  number = 0   // Initialize the variable\"\n",
    "print(transform_comments(\"  number += 1   # Increment the variable\")) \n",
    "# Should be \"  number += 1   // Increment the variable\"\n",
    "print(transform_comments(\"  return(number)\")) \n",
    "# Should be \"  return(number)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The convert_phone_number function checks for a U.S. phone number format: XXX-XXX-XXXX (3 digits followed by a dash, 3 more digits followed by a dash, and 4 digits), and converts it to a more formal format that looks like this: (XXX) XXX-XXXX. Fill in the regular expression to complete this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "def convert_phone_number(phone):\n",
    "  result = re.sub(r'(\\b\\d{3})-(\\d{3}-\\d{4})\\b',r'(\\1) \\2', phone)\n",
    "  return result\n",
    "\n",
    "print(convert_phone_number(\"My number is 212-345-9999.\")) # My number is (212) 345-9999.\n",
    "print(convert_phone_number(\"Please call 888-555-1234\")) # Please call (888) 555-1234\n",
    "print(convert_phone_number(\"123-123-12345\")) # 123-123-12345\n",
    "print(convert_phone_number(\"Phone number of Buckingham Palace is +44 303 123 7300\")) # Phone number of Buckingham Palace is +44 303 123 7300\n",
