    "r\"\\[(\\d+)\\]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This regular expression matches a string enclosed in square brackets followed by one or more digits. Then, it uses the `re.search()` function to search the string log for a match to the regular expression. The `re.search()` function returns a Match object if a match is found, or None if no match is found. the `re.search()` function returns a Match object because the string log contains a match to the regular expression. The Match object has a `group()` method that returns the captured groups from the match. In this case, the only captured group is the number, which is returned by the `result[1]` expression."

    "## **Regular expressions**\n",
    "A regular expression—sometimes called regex—is a string of characters that specifies a pattern to match against some text. In addition to matching patterns, they can search to extract specific parts of text, validate input data, and are supported by code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs). In this reading, you will look at some examples of common regexes used in coding. \n",

    "### **Regex examples**\n",
    "`r”\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}”`  This line of code matches U.S. phone numbers in the format 111-222-3333.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`r”^-?\\d*(\\.\\d+)?$”`  This line of code matches any positive or negative number, with or without decimal places.\n",

    "### **Helpful tool**\n",
    "Sometimes regexes can be complex and difficult to read and understand—even for experienced programmers!
